1. Variables in Python and Strings in Python

Explain what the following code in Python will return:

```python
name = 'bob'
name

name = 'fred'
name
```
* Now go to the website repl.it/languages/python3 and enter in this code, to see if you are correct.
Explain what occurred - and try to use the words *variable*, and *string* in your explanation.

2. Functions in Python

Now take a look at the following code.

```python
def cook_food:
  "hot spaghetti"

food = cook_food
```

What does `food` equal?  Can you make one change to the code so that, if you run the code again, food will equal "hot spaghetti"?  Explain what happened.

3. (Bonus Question) Now write a function `cook_food` so that it will return different values depending on the food passed through as an argument.  For example `cook_food("meatballs")` returns "hot meatballs":

```python
  cook_food('meatballs')
    # => 'hot meatballs'

  cook_food('french fries')
    # => 'hot french fries'
```
